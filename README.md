It had been a mistake for the octocats to leave the bottle of Everclear uncapped on the ledge. 
It was also a mistake for them to have left the magnifying glass lying nearby. 
Things did not go well after the sun came out and the vapors began to rise...
Moral of the story: these files did not need a readme.
